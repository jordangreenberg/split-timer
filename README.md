# split-timer
Software that I wrote to implement a laser design that utilizes laser emitters and photoreceptors to detect curling stone passing points of interest (split time). 
This software was used on our design prototype using Arduino microcontrollers and LCD screens to implement laser system, compute, and output split-time.
