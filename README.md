# Split Timer
This engineering design group project was done during my first year of University. We worked with the Hong Kong International Curling Team
to develop a system to measure split times during curling practices.
This repository includes the Conceptual Design Specifications that we developed and submitted to our client. Within the document are the specifications of our three potential design solutions including the specifications of PhotonRock, our proposed design.
This repository also includes software that I wrote to implement PhotonRock. PhotonRock is a laser system that utilizes laser emitters and photoreceptors to detect a curling stone passing points of interest (split time). 
This software was used on our design prototype that used Arduino microcontrollers and LCD screens to implement the laser system, compute, and output the split time.
Also included in this repository is our Final Presentation that we presented to our client, Engineering Manager, and peers at the conclusion of the project.
